### Hello and Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student at Karelia University of Applied Sciences, currently working towards my BBA in Business Information Technology. I'm interested in coding, machine learning, database and cyber security. Particularly enjoying projects that allow me to solve complex problems and explore innovative data solutions.

This repo is about making my learning visible and party work projects.

I'm always looking to connect!
